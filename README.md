# Terraform module CloudFront Distribution for S3.

A terraform module to a CloudFront Distribution for serving content via a S3 bucket via HTTPS. By default the bucket is private.

By default a route53 record will be created for the provided dns_name. The subdomain is by default a combination of the `environment` and `name`, but can be overridden by providing a `subdomain`. The certificate needs to be a valid certificate and at least available in `us-east-1`.

## Usages

```
module "cloudfront" {
  source = "philips-software/cloudfront-s3/aws"
  version = "1.0.1"

  # Or via github
  # source = "github.com/philips-software/aws-terraform-cloudfront-s3?ref=1.0.1"

  environment = "forest"
  name = "default"

  dns_name   = "mydomain.com"

  ssl_certificate_arn = "ssl_arn"
}

```
The created a bucket can be synced via the cli command:
```
aws s3 sync d --sse --delete . s3://<bucket>
```

## Automated checks
Currently the automated checks are limited. In CI the following checks are done for the root and each example.
- lint: `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt`
- basic init / get check: `terraform init -get -backend=false -input=false`
